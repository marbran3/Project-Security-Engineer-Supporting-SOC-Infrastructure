# Project-Security-Engineer-Supporting-SOC-Infrastructure

This project allowed me to act as a Security Engineer supporting the SOC infrastructure for an imaginary company.
Kibana alerts allowed the SOC Analysts to notice discrepancies. As part of the Security Engineering team, I
was to investigate those discrepancies. Part of the work was done individually, but the final presentation was done
as part of a team of 5 individuals.

Individual tasks included:
   - Defensive: implementing alerts and thresholds in Kibana 
   - Offensive: assess vulnerable VM, triggering Kibana alerts
   - Network: Use Wireshark to analyze live malicious traffic
